# Neet - Nanopore error pattern exploration toolkit

A nuanced understanding of base-calling error patterns emerging from nanopore sequencing holds much potential in the domain of RNA modification detection and beyond. To achieve a better understanding of these, the Nanopore Error pattern Exploration Toolkit (`NEET`) provides a range of functionalities that provide an easily accessible and interactive analysis approach for (systematic) base-calling errors in Nanopore sequencing data. The implemented modules include options for condensing, visualizing and differentiating direct RNA sequencing data.
